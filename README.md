# TAKLUBAN | INTEGRATING POS AND RULE GENERATION IN MULTILINGUAL FILIPINO NATIVE LANGUAGE PROFANE DETECTION

## Overview
TAKLUBAN is a tool designed to enhance profanity detection in Filipino native languages—Tagalog, Bikol, and Cebuano—by integrating Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and rule-based methods. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words approaches, this system employs n-gram algorithms and linguistic rules to achieve context-aware identification of offensive language, ensuring more accurate and culturally sensitive moderation.

The dataset consists of 20,000 entries collected from diverse sources such as GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, tabloids, and platforms like Hugging Face. Comparative evaluation with existing models, including BERT-based detectors, demonstrates TAKLUBAN's effectiveness.

This tool contributes to improving online safety while advancing natural language processing for low-resource languages, setting a standard for inclusive and culturally aware Natural Language Processing (NLP).
